The World Chess Championship 2012 was a chess match between the defending world
champion Viswanathan Anand of India and Boris Gelfand of Israel, winner of the
2011 Candidates Tournament. After sixteen games, including four rapid games,
Anand retained his title. The match, held under the auspices of the World Chess
Federation FIDE, took place between 10 and 30 May 2012 in the Engineering
Building of the State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, Russia. The prize fund was
US$ 2.55 million.

Anand was the defending champion, having gained the title in 2007 and defended
it in 2008 (against Vladimir Kramnik) and in 2010 (against Veselin Topalov).
Boris Gelfand became the challenger in 2012 after winning the eight-player 2011
Candidates Tournament. Anand's subsequent victory, therefore, was his third
consecutive title defence.

The match conditions called for twelve games to be played with classical time
control. If a player scored at least 6Â½ points, he would be declared the winner
and the match ended. By the end of the twelve games, however, the match was tied
at 6 points each, so four rapid games were played in order to produce a result.
Anand won the rapid-game playoff with a win in the second game and draws in the
other three games.
