The World Chess Championship 2010 match pitted the defending world champion,
Viswanathan Anand, against challenger Veselin Topalov, for the title of World
Chess Champion. The match took place in Sofia, Bulgaria from 24 April to 13 May
2010, with a prize fund of 2 million euros (60% to the winner). Anand won the
final game to win the match 6½–5½ and retain the title.

The match was to be twelve games, with tie-breaks if necessary, the same format
and length as the 2006 and 2008 matches.

The start of the match was delayed one day due to air travel disruptions caused
by the volcanic ash emissions from Eyjafjallajökull. Anand was to fly from
Frankfurt to Sofia on 16 April and was stranded because of the eruption. He
asked for a three day postponement, which was refused by the organisers on 19
April. Anand finally reached Sofia on 20 April, after a 40-hour road journey.
The first game was consequently delayed by one day.
