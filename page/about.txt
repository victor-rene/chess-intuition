Chess played by humans is a game of ideas. Unlike computers, humans
players filter bad moves automatically with their intuition.
This intuition is built from experience, but such experience is lacking
for new and improving players.

An important component of chess training is the study of master games.
Other areas of study are more specifc such as openings, tactics or
endgames. Nowadays, there are a lot of tools to train in any area.

However chess games have a 'flow'. In order to learn the strategic ideas
and plans, to remember them, it's necessary to play over complete master
games without the help of an engine. Challenging you to replay games
from chess world championships, this collection of games from world
championships is a tool, that can improve your positional understanding
and vision, by forcing you to recall ideas from elite games.
