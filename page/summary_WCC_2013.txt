The World Chess Championship 2013 was a match between reigning world champion
Viswanathan Anand and challenger Magnus Carlsen, to determine the 2013 World
Chess Champion. It was held from 9 to 22 November 2013 in Chennai, India, under
the auspices of FIDE (the World Chess Federation).

Carlsen won the match 6½–3½ after ten of the twelve scheduled games, becoming
the new world chess champion. This was heralded by Garry Kasparov and others as
the start of a new era in chess, with Carlsen being the first champion to have
developed his game in the age of super-strong chess computers.
