The World Chess Championship 2008 was a best-of-twelve-games match between the
World Chess Champion, Viswanathan Anand, and the previous World Champion,
Vladimir Kramnik. It was understood before the 2007 tournament that if Kramnik
did not win, then the winner would need to play him in a match (lineal
succession). This was the match that was agreed to before the World Championship
tournament of 2007.

After eleven games, Anand successfully defended his title by a final score of
6½–4½ (three victories and one defeat).

The match took place at the Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of
Germany in Bonn, Germany, between 14 October and 29 October 2008.
