Vladimir Borisovich Kramnik (born 25 June 1975) is a Russian chess grandmaster.
He was the Classical World Chess Champion from 2000 to 2006, and the undisputed
World Chess Champion from 2006 to 2007. He has won three team gold medals and
three individual medals at Chess Olympiads.

In October 2000, he defeated Garry Kasparov in a match played in London, and
became the Classical World Chess Champion. In late 2004, Kramnik successfully
defended his title against challenger Péter Lékó in a drawn match played in
Brissago, Switzerland. In October 2006, Kramnik, the Classical World Champion,
defeated reigning FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov in a unification match,
the World Chess Championship 2006. As a result Kramnik became the firs
 undisputed World Champion, holding both the FIDE and Classical titles, since
 Kasparov split from FIDE in 1993. In 2007, Kramnik lost the title to
 Viswanathan Anand, who won the World Chess Championship 2007 tournament ahead
 of Kramnik. He challenged Anand at the World Chess Championship 2008 to regain
 his title, but lost.
