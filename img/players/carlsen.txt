Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess
grandmaster, No. 1 ranked player in the world and reigning World Chess Champion
in classical, rapid and blitz. His peak rating is 2882, the highest in history.

A chess prodigy, Carlsen became a Grandmaster in 2004, at the age of 13 years,
148 days, making him at that time the second youngest grandmaster in history,
although he has since become the third youngest. On 1 January 2010, at the age
of 19 years, 32 days, he became the youngest chess player in history to be
ranked world No. 1. In November 2013, Carlsen defeated Viswanathan Anand in the
World Chess Championship 2013, thus becoming the new world chess champion. On
the May 2014 FIDE rating list, Carlsen reached his top Elo rating of 2882,
the highest in history. He defended his title for the second time during the
World Chess Championship 2014 in November 2014 defeating Anand.

Carlsen was known for his attacking style as a teenager and later developed
into a more universal player. He does not focus on opening preparation as much
as other top players and plays a variety of openings, making it harder for
opponents to prepare against him. His positional mastery and endgame prowess
have drawn comparisons to those of former world champions José Raúl Capablanca,
Vasily Smyslov, and Anatoly Karpov.
